#indentation is a key concept in python. It is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. 
#while other programming languages use curly braces or keywords to define blocks of code, python uses indentation.
if True:
    print('this line is indented')
    #this line is indented with 4 spaces. This is the standard practice in python.
    if True:
        print('this line is indented with 8 spaces')
        #this line is indented with 8 spaces. It is indented further because it is inside another block of code.
#indentation is the bedrock for conditionals, loops, functions and as we see later on, object-oriented programming.
