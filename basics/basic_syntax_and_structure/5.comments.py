#in our previous examples, we have used comments to explain our code.
#comments are lines that are not executed by python. they are used to explain the code and make it more readable.
#in python, everything after a '#' symbol is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter.
#comments can be placed on their own line or at the end of a line of code.

#this is a comment on its own line. this line will be ignored by python.
print('this line of code will be executed')  #this is a comment at the end of a line of code. everything after the '#' will be ignored.
