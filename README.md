# Python Learning Journey

## Introduction
This is not a project. This is a documentation of my learning journey in python, serving as visible proof of my knowledge and a reference guide for me (and others) for projects and coding challenges. 

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.x

## Reflections
This section will track my progress, key learnings, and mistakes to avoid in the future

* 2025,september 1 : created this readme file
* 2025,september 6 : created the basics folder and with that, "introduction to python"
* 2025,september 16 : completed "introduction to python". now I understand more about python and its history, how it works, why its popular/strengths, its weaknesses and workarounds for them, different python IDEs and the python ecosystem. I now realize that python is easy to start with, but deep to master. 
* 2025,september 27: started "basic syntax and structure" and also completed it. I now understand key concepts like syntax, indentation, variables, comments, block statements, etc. I also now know to common pitfalls like multiple statements in a single line. I also got to know how docstrings truly work. I also created the file for "data types and variables"
* 2025, october 5: completed "data types and variables". I have now gained a deeper understanding of variables and also now have an idea of some of the different data types in python like integers, floats, complex numbers, strings and boolean values. I also understood concepts like dynamic typing, type checking, type conversion and multiple variable assignment. I have now found a much more convenient way of swapping variables. I also created the file for "operators"
